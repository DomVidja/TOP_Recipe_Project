            Popular Ivorian meal, the Garba (otherwise named Attiéké and fish) is generally sold by men in small street stalls, called Garbadromes. 
            It consists of Attiéké (cassava semolina) and fried pieces of tuna with chopped onions, tomatoes and fresh peppers, 
            sprinkled with cooking oil and seasoning powder (Cube Maggi). Garba is the quick and cheap meal of choice for young people 
            of Abidjan. So every hour is good to eat it: consistent breakfast, lunch, dinner,...
