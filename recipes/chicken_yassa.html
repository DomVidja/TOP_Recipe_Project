    <h1>Chicken Yassa Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2> <!-- Description of dish -->
        <p>
            Popular across West Africa, chicken yassa coaxes deep flavor from a handful of simple ingredients: 
            smoky grilled chicken, sweet caramelized onions, tangy lime, bright ginger and spicy Scotch bonnet chile. 
            This version comes from “The Fonio Cookbook” by chef Pierre Thiam (Lake Isle Press, 2019). 
            Mr. Thiam, who was born and raised in Dakar, is the chef and owner of Teranga, a West African restaurant in Harlem. 
            His recipe calls for bone-in chicken legs, but, in southern Senegal, where the dish originated, you might be served 
            other chicken parts, fish yassa or even lamb yassa. The cooking method is flexible: The chicken develops the best smoky 
            char when grilled, but will still be delicious seared in a grill pan or cast-iron skillet.
